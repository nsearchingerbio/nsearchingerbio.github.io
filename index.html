					I was born May 17th 1998 on the outskirts of Seoul, South Korea in Anyang, Kyonggi-Do, Korea.  At the age of three months I was adopted by my parents, Timothy and Brigitte Searchinger.  As a kid, I enjoyed playing outside with friends and causing all sorts of trouble a 5-year-old can do in my neighborhood, Takoma Park, in Maryland.  After attending middle school and junior high at the K-12 Potomac School in McLean Virginia, I attended St. John’s College High School (SJC) in Washington DC.  At SJC I joined the crew team in which I participated for all three seasons for all four years.  While at SJC I also joined the Army JROTC Regiment during my Sophomore and Junior years achieving the rank of Staff Sergeant.  This also led me to participate in the JROTC Color Guard, the Rifle Team, and being part of S-6 (a staff position that is the IT for the Regiment).  During the summers of high school I was a Senior Research Aide for the George Washington Institute of Neuroscience. During my senior summer, instead of working at GW I decided to work at a CulinAerie a cooking school in Washington DC.  After four years of high school, I decided to attend Fordham University in the Bronx.  While at Fordham I am currently studying for a B.S in Computer Science.
